# MultiMail
Simple app that sends a text message from an email account

MultiMail is a simple app that I created to send a text message from an e-mail account. Since I cannot know which carrier the cell phone
number belongs to I must send the email to all the major cell carrier gateways in my area, but only the correct one will acutally go
through.

MultiMail has a simple user interface consisting of an input for a telephone number, a drop down menu for selecting templates, a box for 
typing the text message and a button to send.

MultiMail was created for a family insurance agency correspondance and for fun as a personal project.
